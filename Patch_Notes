Patch Notes - Nov 13:
  Created Vit_CMPUT566 repository.
  Uploaded file vision_transformer.py.
  Completed implementation of three classes from models_vit.py:
  IdentityLayer renamed to NamingLayer.
  AddPositionEmbs renamed to PositionalEmbedding.
  MlpBlock renamed to MLP_Encoder.
  Updated MLP_Encoder: The output dimension is now constrained to be equal to the input embedding_dimension, instead of allowing a freely allocated output dimension size.
