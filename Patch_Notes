Patch Notes - Nov 13:
  Created Vit_CMPUT566 repository.
  Uploaded file vision_transformer.py.
  Completed implementation of three classes from models_vit.py:
    IdentityLayer renamed to NamingLayer.
    AddPositionEmbs renamed to PositionalEmbedding.
    MlpBlock renamed to MLP_Encoder.
  Updated MLP_Encoder: The output dimension is now constrained to be equal to the input embedding_dimension, instead of allowing a freely allocated output dimension size.

Patch Notes - Nov 19:
  Archived old versions of Python files.
  Completed implementation of two classes from models_vit.py:
    Encoder1DBlock renamed to Transformer_Encoder.
    Encoder remains unchanged.
  Added assertions in all classes to prevent incorrect input dimension sizes.
  Updated Encoder: The normalization layer now operates with float32 precision.
  Completed syntax error checks for each class.
